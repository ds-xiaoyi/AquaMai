# Fix

Fix of the game's bugs or removal of the game's annoying unuseful "features".

Non-removal "Fix" patches should have no (negative, or any visual changing) side-effects on the original game.

All patches under "Fix" should enabled by default and hide in example. They could be still turned off manually in the config.
